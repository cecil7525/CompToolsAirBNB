# CompToolsAirBNB
AirBNB data processing for the Computational tools for data science project. 

## Data retrieval 
You can access the data used for our project through the below link:
[Data Link]({https://dtudk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/s201700_dtu_dk/EhIU_vU44G9Pj7ahGRCN1vEBEC0E7Gr-WxKQbssX4OrA_w?e=6rAiCJ)
- Note that you have to use a DTU Microsoft account to access the data files.

Once you have access you can download the files and add that to the same folder you intend to run the code from. (Some files are output files)  

## Run code 
Follow the main Jupyter Notebook, *cs4ds.ipynb*, to run the code
- Note: The sentiment analysis takes a lot of time and was done using DTU's HPC.
